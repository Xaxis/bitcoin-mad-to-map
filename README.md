## MAD is (obviously) completely insane

Mutually assured destruction is a horror story we told ourselves to stay disciplined. It mostly worked, until it sort of did not. We got proxy wars, hair trigger alerts, false warnings, missiles on trains, all the pathology of fear based incentives. MAD says stability lives in the shadow of annihilation. I do not buy that as a permanent operating system. Humans adapt. Norms erode. Attention spans shrink. Software eats procedures. The next crisis will not care how many think pieces were written about restraint.

If MAD is not the equilibrium we want, what is? The answer has to be simple enough that leaders cannot weasel out, hard enough that cheating hurts, and visible enough that everyone can watch the same truth at the same time. That sounds more like a cryptographic system than a diplomatic vibe. Treaties need teeth that bite automatically. Proofs need to travel faster than press releases. And money needs to be wired up so it bleeds the moment you lie.

## What a better equilibrium actually requires

Let me be clear about the shape of the thing. A durable peace incentive needs three pillars:

1. **Credible commitments** that are expensive to reverse. No more soft promises. Precommitment is real only when walking away burns capital on contact.
2. **Public verifiability** that is global and tamper evident. If truth lives in a closed room, politics will distort it. Push the commitments into a place where anyone can confirm the hash of reality.
3. **Tight feedback** between violation and cost. Sanctions that arrive months later are theater. The penalty has to clear before the press conference starts.

You can build this with Bitcoin as the settlement layer and a careful set of oracles plus zero knowledge proofs on the monitoring side. The chain does not decide geopolitical truth. It simply acts like a locked box that opens or slams shut when real world signals cross threshold. The credibility comes from the cost of overriding settlement and the fact that state updates are hard to censor or edit after the fact.

## Bitcoin is not a mascot here

Why Bitcoin and not whatever protocol is trending this quarter. Three reasons.

First, **neutrality**. You want the settlement layer that neither adversary can capture or quietly roll back on a Sunday night. Bitcoin has the best track record for finality, client diversity, and political neutrality.

Second, **simplicity that still composes**. Multisig, timelocks, hashed commits, covenant like controls where available, and off chain logic that outputs a plain spend condition. Keep the on chain part boring and conservative. Put the complex governance in the oracle committees and dispute windows where you can swap people without touching the base layer.

Third, **energy backed security**. If the penalty of a treaty breach is locked inside a UTXO, you want the cost of reorganizing it to be astronomical. Paid heat is not a metaphor. It is a property.

## The move from MAD to MAP

Call the new equilibrium **MAP: Mutually Assured Proving**. The idea is embarrassingly straightforward. If you want peace, you do not need to make destruction more terrifying. You need to make truth more expensive to ignore.

MAP is a bundle of mechanisms:

- **Treaty Triggered State Bonds** where signatories pre post Bitcoin collateral into a timelocked multisig that releases funds automatically on attested violations.
- **Dominant Assurance Contracts for Peace** where rivals escrow toward de escalation milestones and get refunds with a bonus if the other side fails to participate. No one is the sucker who goes first and gets punished.
- **Mutually Auditable Safeguards** where sensitive inventories and facility states are committed as hashes anchored to Bitcoin and proven compliant with zero knowledge proofs. The public sees integrity without seeing secrets.
- **Sensor Paid Markets** where independent satellites, seismometers, and traffic watchers get Lightning micropayments for signed observations that reconcile across a quorum.
- **Risk Pricing and Insurance** where forecast markets and premium curves rise automatically as brinkmanship indicators worsen.

Tie those together and you get a system that makes cheating painful, compliance cheap, and verification boring.

## Treaty Triggered State Bonds in practice

Imagine two states that both say they will not conduct explosive nuclear tests and will stick to a declared cap on deployed warheads. They sign yet another document. Nice. Now make it costly.

Each parks a visible pot of BTC in a vault governed by three keys: the state, a rotating neutral custodian group, and an oracle committee. The covenant is simple. If a defined set of sensors report a violation at a threshold, and the claim survives a short dispute window, a slice of that pot streams out. Some to the harmed counterparty, some to a public pool that funds remediation or humanitarian relief. There is no waiting for a council vote. The money knows what to do.

Costly signals work because they are costly. The bond turns a press statement into a prepayment. Leaders can posture on television, but the UTXO does not care. If you cheat, you bleed.

## The assurance problem and how to kill it

Many de escalation moves die in coordination failure. Each side wants to do the right thing only if the other side does the right thing too. Dominant assurance contracts fix that. Structure it so each party deposits toward a transparent threshold. If everyone crosses the line by a given date, the funds release to pay for dismantlement teams, removal of forward deployed systems, or whatever the package requires. If the threshold is not met, each contributor gets a refund plus a small bonus paid by a sponsor. That bonus is the bribe that flips waiting into acting. No one is punished for going first. Everyone is punished for lying.

When you run these on top of Bitcoin, the timing is credible. Settlement finality is shared reality. The clock is not owned by a single country or institution.

## Proving without spying

Verification is always the hardest part. You want strong confidence and low exposure. The way out is to keep raw data off chain and anchor only commitments plus proofs. Facilities produce snapshots, inventory deltas, and activity logs. Hash them, sign them, and anchor batched roots to Bitcoin. Publish zero knowledge proofs that your declared stockpile is within bounds and that your activity pattern matches your declaration. Auditors can check the math without seeing the map. If an inspection is later required, the commitments make post hoc edits detectable.

This is not a surveillance playground. It is a tamper evidence machine.

## A concrete scenario I would actually run

Take a South Asia test moratorium 2.0. Both states post bonds. Triggers include seismic yield signatures crossing a well defined line, launch telemetry that matches ballistic testing, or construction activity at declared test sites outside allowed windows. Independent satellite operators, regional seismic networks, and academic labs form the oracle committee. Attestations require cross sensor consensus. The dispute window is short but real, with a right to publish counter evidence that will be judged by a fresh jury of verifiers sampled from a larger pool. False attestors get slashed from their staked pool and lose future fee access.

Layer a DAC on top for dismantling a specific set of delivery systems or for a schedule of transparency steps. Either both sides hit the milestones and the funds pay the work, or the contract gracefully unwinds and principals get made whole. No secret side deals. No performative ambiguity.

## What breaks this and how to harden it

You still have oracle risk. Any mechanism that touches the real world does. The mitigations are straight out of security engineering. Diverse sensors with independent operators. Randomized committee selection per epoch. Clear slashing for bad attestations. Strong identity for verifiers paired with bright line conflicts of interest that kill eligibility. Most importantly, keep the on chain logic dumb and verifiable. All the complexity lives where you can swap parts without rewriting money.

You also have attribution risk. Was that seismic signal a test or a mine collapse. This is why cross sensor voting and short disputes matter. We are trading speed for correctness carefully. The goal is fast enough to deter and accurate enough to be legitimate.

Finally you have the political lift of escrowing national funds. Audience costs can work for you here. Leaders who truly want stability can point to the bond and say we did not just say it. We paid in advance to make breaking our word expensive.

## Why this still beats fear

MAD relies on a threatened future. MAP relies on a metered present. Under MAD, punishment is hypothetical and delivered by leaders who might flinch or misread. Under MAP, punishment is automatic and delivered by a vault that only recognizes proofs. That change in timing is the whole game. You do not wait for sanctions committees and grainy satellite photos on cable news. You structure the system so that cheating flips a spend condition and money moves.

This is not utopian. It is boring by design. You can start small. Pick a single treaty clause and wire it up. Test moratoria are a good first target. Next try launch notification windows with deposits that leak if you surge activity without notice. Then inventory deltas proved in zero knowledge. Over time the surface area grows. The habit forms. The incentive points away from brinkmanship and toward predictable compliance because that is where the losses are smallest and the insurance is cheapest.

## The hopeful outlook

Peace can be more than a vibe. It can arise from the proper incentive deisgn. If you want rivals to behave, pay for a system that makes proofs abundant, edits expensive, and lies unprofitable. Bitcoin is not the whole answer, but it is the best spine we have for credible settlement and global auditability. Build on that spine and you get a new order that does not depend on everyone being calm forever. It depends on the oldest truth in markets. People respect what costs them.

MAD built a world that survived by looking over the cliff. MAP builds a world that keeps receipts. I know which one I want running in the background when the next false alarm hits at 3 a.m.
